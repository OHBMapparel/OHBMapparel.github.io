## Instructions for making your very own OHBM 2020 pajamas

### 1. Create a sewing pattern



### 2. Order custom fabric

You can make the pattern using any fabric you'd like, but in the spirit of OHBM 2020, we've created a custom plaid design based on the color themes of the conference logo:

We'd recommend ordering 2.5 to 3 meters (depending on size) of cotton poplin from the following link. Any additional fabric would be well suited for making a few masks for the rare occasion you need to leave the house, but don't want to leave the spirit of the conference behind.
