## Instructions for making your very own OHBM 2020 pajamas

### 1. Create a sewing pattern

Following is a link we put together to create a custom sewing pattern for pajamas:

### 2. Order custom fabric

You can make the pattern using any fabric you'd like, but in the spirit of OHBM 2020, we've created a custom plaid design based on the color themes of the conference logo:

We'd recommend ordering 3 to 4 meters (depending on pattern size) of **cotton poplin** at the **largest width** from the link below. Any additional fabric would be well suited for making a few masks on the rare occasion you need to leave the house, but don't want to leave the spirit of the conference behind.

### 3. Make the pajamas

At this point you can either fire up the sewing machine or find a local tailor to finish the job.
